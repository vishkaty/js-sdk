# script has ever used -- exhausts that budget before the graph is fully
# ordered and silently drops several response-envelope types
# (CheckoutResponseSchema, UcpResponseSchema, UcpCheckoutResponseSchema,

# pinned resources, no newly-discovered capability involved: this is a
# pre-existing quicktype limitation exposed by 2026-08-25's larger content,
# not something this fix introduces). Putting discovery/*.json LAST resolves
# the same graph within budget, but also changes declaration ORDER in the
# output (not content), which would break byte-identity against the pinned
# 2026-04-08 release for no reason -- it never needs the fallback.
# So: try the original (discovery-first) order first, exactly as before.

# Capabilities and transport envelopes the projector discovered by shape
# (any new lookup/search/checkout-order-cart-extension capability under
# schemas/common/, or a new transport message envelope) are not hardcoded
# below: they are read from the manifest project-current-ucp-schemas.mjs
# writes, so a spec release adding another one does not require editing this
# script. See discoverAdditionalCapabilities/discoverTransportEnvelopes.
#
# Each discovered capability is generated in its OWN small quicktype
# invocation (grouped by capability, so its create/update/response fragments
# travel together), rather than joining the main invocation's --src list.
# Two independent reasons:
#   1. quicktype's typescript-zod target cannot represent every JSON Schema
#      shape -- e.g. an allOf that re-adds named properties alongside a host
#      object whose own additionalProperties is a schema, not a boolean (hit
#      by payment_authentication's checkout attachment: it re-embeds
#      checkout.json via $ref and layers named "actions" entries on top of
#      checkout's own open action map). A newly-discovered capability hitting
#      that limitation must not abort generation for every other capability
#      and the pinned resources.
#   2. quicktype's type-ordering pass has a fixed iteration budget
#      ("Exceeded maximum number of passes when determining output order").
#      Folding every discovered family into the SAME invocation as the nine
#      pinned resources pushes the combined graph over that budget, and
#      quicktype does not fail loudly when this happens -- it silently drops
#      types instead (reproduced: CheckoutResponseSchema/
#      UcpDiscoveryProfileSchema vanished with no non-zero exit code or
#      per-type error). Keeping each family in its own bounded invocation,
#      proven to stay under budget individually, avoids the failure mode
#      entirely rather than working around its symptom.
# This runs AFTER the main invocation above, not before: quicktype's own
# ordering pass turned out to be sensitive to how many prior `npx quicktype`
# processes had already run in the same shell session (observed: the main
# invocation alone succeeds consistently; the identical invocation run after
# nine preceding quicktype calls fails consistently, on the identical input
# -- almost certainly process/resource churn in quicktype's own tooling, not
# a property of the schemas). Generating the pinned resources FIRST, while
# nothing else has run yet, keeps their generation deterministic; the
# per-family probes below going second cannot un-succeed something already
# written to disk.
# A family whose invocation fails outright is EXCLUDED from this
# regeneration -- there is no way to hand quicktype a shape it cannot
# represent -- but that exclusion must never be silent. Two outcomes,
# decided by scripts/check-generation-completeness.mjs after this loop:
#   - the family is on that script's KNOWN_UNREPRESENTABLE_FAMILIES: a human
#     has already verified quicktype cannot do this, so it is logged loudly
#     as a WARNING and the run continues.
#   - the family is NOT on that list: this is a NEW, unreviewed failure --
#     it must not be silently swallowed as "the isolation mechanism just
#     protected the rest of the run" (that fail-open is exactly how a real
#     regression -- the isolation mechanism itself breaking, or a genuinely
#     fixable schema bug -- would hide forever). Generation FAILS, forcing
#     a human to either fix the schema/mechanism or add a reviewed,
#     justified entry to KNOWN_UNREPRESENTABLE_FAMILIES.
# A family whose invocation succeeds is kept as a fragment file and merged
# into the main output (via merge-generated-fragment.mjs, below) rather than
# redeclaring the shared discovery/*.json types a second time.
#
# The reviewed-exclusion allowlist and the accept/reject decision both live
# in scripts/check-generation-completeness.mjs, not here: pure string-list
# logic with no shell quoting is easier to get right and directly unit-
# testable (tests/check-generation-completeness.test.js) independent of
# whether the full pipeline can run end to end against any given spec tree.
# This loop only collects the family names that failed; the decision (and
# the exit) happens once, after the loop, below.

  # common/types/constraint_expression.json, genuinely self-referential,
  # its type-ordering pass "Exceeded maximum number of passes when

  #
  # A plain discovery-only baseline, computed once here rather than per

  # families also produce it. A common/types file whose root schema is a
  # bare scalar (e.g. reverse_domain_name.json, a pattern-constrained
  # string with no object properties) has nothing for quicktype's
  # schema-mode to name at the top level, so it legitimately contributes
  # zero new exports. A common/types file already reachable TRANSITIVELY
  # from discovery/*.json alone (e.g. available_payment_instrument.json,
