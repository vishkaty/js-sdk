// Decides whether a set of discovered-family quicktype failures should fail
// the whole generate_models.sh run, or be waved through as already-reviewed.
//
// Why this is its own script rather than inline bash: generate_models.sh's
// per-family isolation loop (see the comment there) generates each newly-
// discovered capability in its own quicktype invocation so ONE unrepresentable
// shape cannot abort generation for every other family and the pinned
// resources. That isolation was itself found to be a fail-open: a failing
// family was logged and skipped, but the script still exited 0, so a NEW,
// unreviewed failure (a mechanism regression, or a genuinely fixable schema
// issue) could silently ship an incomplete src/spec_generated.ts. The fix is
// this gate: every family that fails must be on KNOWN_UNREPRESENTABLE_FAMILIES
// below (WARNING, continue) or the run FAILS (ERROR, exit 1). Isolating the
// decision here -- pure string-list logic, no shell quoting, no quicktype,
// no fixture spec tree -- makes it directly unit-testable
// (tests/check-generation-completeness.test.js) independent of whether the
// full pipeline can run end to end against any given spec tree.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-generation-completeness.mjs <failedFamily> ...
// Exits 0 if every failed family is reviewed (or there are none), 1 otherwise.

// Reviewed, justified exclusions only -- each entry here must cite the exact
// quicktype failure and why it is a genuine tool limitation, not a mechanism
// bug this script could instead fix. Keep this list and generate_models.sh's
// own copy of the reasoning in sync; this file is the single source of truth
// for WHICH families are excluded, generate_models.sh's comment carries the
// full WHY.

  // common/payment_authentication -- its "actions" attachment redeclares
  // checkout's "actions" property with BOTH fixed named keys (the new Action
  // types) AND an inherited open catch-all (checkout's own actions.json is a
  // schema-typed additionalProperties map). Verified by direct, minimal
  // reproduction (a single top-level { properties: {...}, additionalProperties:
  // <schema> } object, no allOf, no cross-file $refs) that quicktype's
  // typescript-zod target cannot represent "named keys plus a schema-typed
  // catch-all on the same object" AT ALL -- "Internal error: ." with zero
  // further detail, independent of the allOf-merge machinery in this repo.
  "common/payment_authentication",
  // common/types/constraint_expression -- 2026-08-25's Object Constraint
  // schema, genuinely self-referential ("$ref": "#" pointing at its own
  // whole document). quicktype's typescript-zod target cannot place a type
  // like this AT ALL -- verified in total isolation (this one schema, zero
  // other content): it exhausts its internal type-ordering pass and
  // silently emits nothing, with only a WARNING ("Exceeded maximum number
  // of passes when determining output order, output may contain forward
  // references") and NO non-zero exit. In its actual per-family invocation
  // (bundled with --src discovery/*.json, as every family is, so quicktype
  // can resolve $refs into it) this failure mode is even quieter: the
  // shared discovery content still generates successfully alongside it, so
  // the fragment is non-empty and the process still exits 0 -- the family
  // contributes zero export declarations beyond that shared baseline,
  // which is what generate_models.sh's per-family loop now checks for
  // directly (see its own comment) rather than relying on exit code or a
  // non-empty fragment alone. This is the exact failure mode issue #64
  // documents.
  "common/types/constraint_expression",
  // common/types/request_constraints -- the SAME underlying limitation as
  // constraint_expression above, reached a different way: its own
  // "properties.additionalProperties" and "anyOf.items" both $ref
  // constraint_expression.json directly (a oneOf branch and an items
  // schema, not a property that is ONLY a $ref, so
  // dropSelfReferentialProperties -- scoped deliberately narrowly, see its
  // own comment in scripts/project-current-ucp-schemas.mjs -- does not
  // catch it the way it catches available_payment_instrument.json's
  // "constraints" property). Verified directly: its own per-family
  // invocation logs the identical "Exceeded maximum number of passes"
  // warning and contributes zero export declarations beyond the shared
  // discovery baseline, the same signature as constraint_expression
  // itself, not a new or different failure.
