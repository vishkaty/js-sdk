// Regression coverage for the "never silently drop a discovered family"
// completeness gate. generate_models.sh's per-family isolation mechanism
// (each newly-discovered capability gets its own quicktype invocation, so
// one unrepresentable shape cannot abort generation for every other family)
// was itself found to be a fail-open: a family that failed its invocation
// was logged and skipped, but the whole script still exited 0. That means a
// genuinely fixable regression -- or the isolation mechanism itself
// breaking -- could silently ship an incomplete src/spec_generated.ts with
// no red anywhere.
//
// scripts/check-generation-completeness.mjs is the fix: every family that
// fails must be on KNOWN_UNREPRESENTABLE_FAMILIES (a short, reviewed list,
// each entry citing the exact quicktype failure) or the run exits non-zero.
// This is tested here directly, independent of quicktype or any spec tree
// (fixture or real), because the decision itself is pure string-list logic
// -- exercising it through the full pipeline would make this test depend on
// the fixture tree being complete enough for generate_models.sh's hardcoded
// pinned --src list, which is a separate, pre-existing concern unrelated to
// this gate.
