// Regression coverage for the generation pipeline being broken at the root
// against a reorganized spec tree (the 2026-08-25 release moved ~work
// schemas from schemas/shopping/ to a new schemas/common/ tree, renamed the
// AP2 mandate extension, and published a canonical `keys` profile document
// where none existed before). tests/fixtures/reorg-spec is a small synthetic
// tree reproducing that shape (NOT the full real spec) so this test is fast,
// deterministic, and does not depend on network access or a real UCP
// checkout.
//
// Before the fix in scripts/project-current-ucp-schemas.mjs, running this
// against the fixture crashed:
//   SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON
//     at clone (scripts/project-current-ucp-schemas.mjs:176)
//     at renameExtensionCheckoutDef (...:998)
//     at writeCompatibilityAp2Schema (...:1076)
// because writeCompatibilityAp2Schema hardcoded the AP2 extension's
// pre-reorg path (shopping/ap2_mandate.json), and loadSchemaCache never
// walked schemas/common/ root files at all, so the schema was never found
// even by accident.
